# Lab_4.Strings

This is a branch of the [Java-BSU](https://github.com/KoAlexandra13/Java-BSU/) repository.


## Lab 4 - **String, StringBuffer, StringTokenizer classes**.

Variant 2.

# Problem

The program asks for two lines and an integer number P to search for. 

The first line contains tokens consisting of any characters that can be entered from the keyboard, e.g. a number (see individual variants, 2nd or 8th or 10th or 16th number).


The second line contains separators (1 separator is 1 character, but there can be >1 separator and different separators between tokens).


**Tasks**:

- Divide the first line into tokens (using the separators from the second line)

- Find all the the decimals of the 8th calculus. Write these decimals into a new separate array. 

- Among tokens that are not numbers, find tokens that are not palindromes. 

- Find the number P (if any, it should coincide with the token), display the position in the original line. 

- Add a random number to the string after the number P or in the middle of the string (if there is no P). 

- The substring that begins with a number - remove from the string. 

- Print all the results.


*Use methods*:


- For String: format, getChars, Split, Remove, Substring, Replace, IndexOf, LastIndexOf


- For StringBuffer: delete, insert, reverse
